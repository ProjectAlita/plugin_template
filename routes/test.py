        Route Resource

        self is pointing to current Module instance

        By default routes are prefixed with module name
        Example:
        - pylon is at "https://example.com/"
        - module name is "demo"
        - route is "/"
        Route URL: https://example.com/demo/

        web.route decorator takes the same arguments as Flask route
        Note: web.route decorator must be the last decorator (at top)

        Route resources use check auth decorator
        auth.decorators.check takes the following arguments:
        - permissions
        - scope_id=1
